I am a first-year PhD student in Statistics and Computer Science at Bocconi University.  
My main research interests are Bayesian Nonparametrics, Asymptotic Statistics, and Stochastic Processes.

I have recently completed my integrated master's degree at Imperial College London. I wrote my thesis, 'A Bayesian fractional posterior approach to the Gaussian white noise model', under the supervision of Dr. Kolyan Ray. This project extended the theory of Gaussian process priors in the Gaussian white noise model to the case of fractional posteriors.
